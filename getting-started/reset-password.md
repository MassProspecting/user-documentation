## Why You Need to Reset

When you [sign up for MassProspecting](../getting-started/signin-up.md), you only provide your email address. Our system automatically generates a strong, random password for your account. This means **you won't know your initial password**, making password reset an essential first step to gain access to your account and secure it with a password you choose and remember.

**TL;DR:** Your initial password is randomly generated and unknown to you, so you must reset it to create one you'll actually know.
