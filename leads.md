# Managing Leads

![Campaign Overview](assets/leads-01.png)

The Leads section is your central hub for managing all prospects discovered through scraping or imported into your campaigns. Here you can review, filter, edit, and organize your leads before and during outreach campaigns.

## Step-by-Step Leads Management Guide

### 1. Access Your Campaigns
Navigate to the campaigns page in your MassProspecting dashboard:
**https://massprospecting.com/app/campaigns**

### 2. Locate Your Campaign
Find the campaign containing the leads you want to manage from your list of existing campaigns. Each campaign card displays key metrics like:
- Total leads discovered
- Processing completion percentage
- Valid emails found after filtering

### 3. Open Leads View
Click the **"View Leads"** link on your campaign card to access all leads associated with that campaign.

### 4. Navigate the Leads Interface

The leads screen is divided into two main panels:

**Left Panel - Leads List:**
- Displays all leads scraped or imported into the campaign
- Shows basic information: first name, last name, and headline
- Note: Presence in this list means the lead was discovered, not necessarily contacted yet

**Right Panel - Lead Details:**
- Shows comprehensive contact information when a lead is selected
- Allows editing of lead data directly in the fields
- Displays all available contact points and social profiles

### 5. Filter Your Leads

- And other custom criteria

### 6. View and Edit Lead Information
Click on any lead in the left panel to view their complete details in the right panel. You can:
- Edit contact information directly
