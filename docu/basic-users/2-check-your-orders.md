# Check Your Orders

Once you’ve placed a scraping order, you can track its performance and manage it from your dashboard.

---

## 📊 Order Statistics

Each order box shows 3 key metrics:

![Order Statistics](../../assets/dashboard-01.png)

- 🟣 Leads Discovered: Total number of posts that showed up using your [LinkedIn search](#-view-the-linkedin-search).
- 🟢 % Leads Processed: The percentage of discovered leads that have already been analyzed and enriched.
- 🔵 Valid Emails After Filters: How many of those leads had valid emails and passed your filters (e.g. country, headcount, etc).

You can use these stats to understand how well your filters are performing — and if your outreach-ready leads are increasing day by day.

## ⏯️ Pause or Resume an Order

You can pause or resume any scraping order anytime using the button on the top right of the order card.

This is useful if you want to conserve credits or make adjustments before continuing.
