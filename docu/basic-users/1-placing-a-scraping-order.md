## Overview

In MassProspecting, scraping orders allow you to automate lead generation by specifying the type of people and posts you want to target on LinkedIn.

Placing an order involves 3 steps:

---

## Step 1 – Search for Relevant Posts

Start by entering keywords your ideal leads might post about.

For example: “for rent”, “launching a product”, “funding”, “hiring”.

You can also filter by job title and industry to better target the authors of those posts.

## Step 2 – Enrich with Data Points

MassProspecting appends extra information to each lead, such as:

- Valid Email Address ✅
- Direct Phone Number ✅
