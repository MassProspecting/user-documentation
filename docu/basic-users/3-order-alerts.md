# Alerts

Sometimes, a scraping order may be automatically paused and placed “On Hold.”

There are two possible reasons for this:

---

## 1. ⚠️ Insufficient Credits

If your account runs out of data-credits, your scraping order will be paused until you recharge.

In this case:

- The alert reads: “On Hold: Paused due to insufficient data-credits”
- The “Credits Remaining” counter will show a negative number
- You’ll need to purchase more credits to resume processing

🟢 Once you top up your credits, the order will automatically resume.

## 2. ⚠️ Low Performance

If the system detects your filters are yielding very few valid leads (e.g. valid emails or leads who pass your filters), the order will be paused and you have to create a better performing order.

This may happen when:

- You’re targeting a niche audience that rarely posts
- Your filters are too restrictive
- Your keywords don’t match recent posts

To fix this:

- [Place a new order](./1-placing-a-scraping-order.md) using broader filters
- Use more common keywords
- Expand your country or headcount filters

It is not possible to edit your existing order.
