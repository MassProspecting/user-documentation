# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

---

### 🔐 Should I connect my own LinkedIn account for scraping?

No. MassProspecting provides built-in LinkedIn accounts for scraping, so you don’t need to connect or risk your personal account.

This keeps your LinkedIn profile safe while still getting fresh, real-time data from the platform.

### ❓ What is a credit?

1 credit is consumed for each lead discovered that matches your order filters and includes a verified email address.

If you requested phone numbers, an additional 2 credits are used per lead that includes a direct phone number — bringing the total to 3 credits per lead with phone.

---

### ⏱️ How long does it take to get my data?

We typically scrape up to 25 new LinkedIn posts per hour.

The number of leads you receive each day depends on:

1. How many new posts appear in your LinkedIn search results every hour.
2. How many of those posts are authored by people who match your filters and have a verified email (and direct phone number, if required).

---

### 🎁 How many leads will I get during the trial?

During the $1 trial, you receive up to 20 credits.

The number of leads that you will receive depends if you have requested **valid email addresses** only (1 credit per lead) or **valid email addresses** and **direct phone numbers** (3 credits per lead).

---

### 📞 Do all leads include phone numbers?

It depends on your order settings:

- If you selected “only leads with phone numbers,” then yes — all your leads will include a phone number and cost 3 credits each.
- If you did not request phone numbers, then none of your leads will include one, and each lead will cost just 1 credit.

---

### 📱 Are all phone numbers mobile numbers?

Not necessarily. When available, we prioritize direct mobile numbers. However, some numbers may be landlines, company desk phones, or VoIP numbers.

---

### 📧 Are all the emails valid?

Yes. We run real-time email verification before delivering a lead. Only emails marked as "valid" are included in your list — minimizing bounce rates.

---

### 💬 What is a talk signal?

A talk signal is a clue that someone recently posted something relevant on LinkedIn, and may be open to a conversation.

For example, someone posting about hiring, launching a new service, raising funds, or celebrating a promotion. These “talk signals” help you engage leads at the right moment — when they’re most active and approachable.

---

### 🔁 Do my credits roll over?

Yes — but only for 3 months.

If credits go unused for more than 3 consecutive months, they will expire. Make sure to keep your scraping orders running so you make full use of your credits.
