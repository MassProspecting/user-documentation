# Connecting OpenAI for Outreach Personalization

![Integrations Overview](assets/openai-01.png)

OpenAI is the brain behind your outreach. By integrating it with MassProspecting, you leverage advanced LLMs (Large Language Models) to generate hyper-personalized first lines and intelligent replies. It also analyzes lead signals to score and prioritize who is most likely to engage, transforming your outreach from generic blasts into meaningful, context-aware conversations.

## Step-by-Step Connection Guide

### 1. Access the Integrations Page
Navigate to the OpenAI integration page in your MassProspecting dashboard:
**https://massprospecting.com/app/integrations/openai**

### 2. Check Available Slots
On the integrations page, you'll see the status of the OpenAI service. The interface shows:

*   **Self-service slots (`self`)**: Available for your own API connections.
*   **DFY slots (`dfy` or `#y`)**: Managed by the MassProspecting team.

The notation indicates:
*   `(self: X/Y)` - Your available/used self-service slots (e.g., `0/1` or `1/1`).
*   `(dfy: X/Y)` - Available/used DFY slots.
*   The total count shows overall connection capacity.

### 3. Connect Your OpenAI Account

**How to Generate an OpenAI API Key:**
1.  Go to the OpenAI platform portal: [https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2.  Sign in to your account.
3.  Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner and select **View API keys**.

> **Important:** Your API key is like a password. Store it securely and never share it publicly. For detailed OpenAI API documentation, visit their official guide: [OpenAI API Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference).

### 5. Managing Your Connection
To release an occupied slot (e.g., to use a new API key), click the **Disconnect** button associated with that specific slot.
